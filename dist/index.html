    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <h3>
      You may have heard that there has been a planning application notice posted for the use of the former Jewson's builders yard as a site of purpose-built student accommodation. We are running a quick survey to gather the views of the local community around Eyre Place, Eyre Place Lane, Rodney Street and Rodney Place. If you are a resident, owner or frequent visitor to the area, we would really appreciate your views:

      <h3>We know that contributing to planning consultations can take a great deal of individual effort. Over the coming weeks, we plan to add resources to this page to make the process as easy as possible. We've included a contact form at the bottom, where you can sign up to receive updates at key stages in the process.</h3>

        <li><strong>15th Feb 2022 - 9th March 2022</strong>: 'Virtual consultation' period opens for providing input to the developer online. This is separate to the formal planning consultation run by the council.</li>
